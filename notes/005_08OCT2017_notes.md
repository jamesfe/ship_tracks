## Notes

Today I discovered that in fact some tracks last for up to a month.  This means I've been duplicating data (argh!) across multiple days which isn't in itself so terrible.

What this means for me is that I can't use my daily files to generate hourly files since I can't deduplicate the data easily across days.

Also I am noticing that each hour will have a goodly amount of data and JavaScript doesn't like holding more than a day's worth of data in memory (sometimes not even a day).

The solution to this is to make each hourly file just a NLJSON (new line json) file instead of an entire array.  This is more 'big-data'ish but in this case I think the decision is warranted.  


## TO DO


- [ ] Regenerate the 2013 JSON file and maybe get rid of the daily files
- [ ] Process one day at a time and append the output to the hourly file
- [ ] Only write one line of JSON in append-mode to a file rather than dump the file at once
