# Cumulative Work

## Progress so far

I threw away the `running_buckets` code in favor of a new library I found called `turf.js`.  It seems nice so far so I'm goign to use it.

Below is some progress

## (PREVIOUS) TO DO

- [X] Copy `running_buckets` code in
- [X] Synchronously read a file line by line
- [X] From timestamp, get seconds
- [X] Calculate start and end buckets
- [ ] Probably write tests
- [ ] Set up auto-linting as part of tests
- [ ] Set up a bounding box & check
- [ ] Adapt `running_buckets` code to break by selected number of seconds


## TO DO

- [ ] Check feature overlap with bounding box for inclusion (runtime)
- [ ] Output features into hourly files
- [ ] Create and modify `render` script so it reads the new files
- [ ] Do an animation!
