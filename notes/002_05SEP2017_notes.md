How do we get the tracks into the right buckets?

Also, we might want each track to fall into more than one bucket (for animation purposes).

So what we have is a dict or an array, containing many slots for data.

We need to take (start + end) time and make a function that returns some indices in the dict/array.

So we can say: "My time window is 2 days" but what we are really saying is: hash this down to a number representing a two day interval and give me some bucket numbers to add it to.

So let's try this:

Date = xyz
Buckets = 2 day buckets
First date = bucket 0
Last date = bucket n
Hash of date XYZ is to take start and subtract first date, then divide by the number of seconds in our bucket and round.
