=====

1. We are dividing the segments the right way: I have added unit tests and we can see the lines are being properly created.
2. The input data has not changed that I can tell. 
3. When we plot the items, they appear around (-66, 18)
4. When we plot the harbor, it appears around (-74, 40)
5. We know this isn't a quadrant swap (x,y) => (y,x)
6. The original data seems to be in this area as well.
7. The data appears to be aligned with San Juan in Puerto Rico for some fucking reason.
8. Maybe there is no data for Jan 1 in NYC?
